This directory (csrc/) contains the old (and less efficient (and probably 
broken)) C source code for dirmirror.  It is left in the distribution in hopes 
that eventually it will be fixed.

The major planned changes for the C source code are as follows:

* Use a queue structure instead of recursion.  dirmirror generates MANY stack
  frames when operating over a large directory structure.
* Remove dependence on dirent.h so that the program is written in 100% ANSI
  C.

Any patches to this end are appreciated.
