Dirmirror

This program allows one to make an exact copy of a given directory structure, 
ignoring all files and symlinks. If the target directory is a subdirectory
of the source directory (regardless of depth), the target directory will not
be mirrored.

TO COMPILE:

    g++ -o dm dirmirror.cpp

This program has been tested on Linux (x86, amd64), FreeBSD 5.3-RELEASE, and
Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger).
